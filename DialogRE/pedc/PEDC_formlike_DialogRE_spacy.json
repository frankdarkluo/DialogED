   "Veronica: Well, Gideon's primary objective in life is to be my mate. And so every other person or creature that comes near me is a threat to our relationship. And my children are a very big threat to our relationship because we have physical contact with each other. She sees me carrying them and cooking for them and touching them and picking them up. And so she has a desire to kill them, basically. I mean, in the bird world, she would kill another predator or some intrusive love interest.",

   "Rochelle Garza: Yeah, no. I guess I'm just trying to figure out a way that I can explain that I'm an attorney and that I'm the attorney assisting the parent. And the parent has asked me to locate the child. So that way, I can speak with her. Is there any email address that I can maybe send a letter of representation to? Even if it's to someone at your office.",

   "Alan: No, it's OK. No, I only have the information for the minors. I don't have the for the adults. I mean, I can't go to the ICE locator and find them, but",
   "Ira Glass: This surprised me. Is he saying that his database lists the child and where the child is, but doesn't have the parent's name attached to that?",
   "Kevin Sieff: Yeah. I mean, he's telling Rochelle that he has no record of even that parent's name, let alone where that parent's located. I mean, and this, I think, is the biggest concern that lawyers have right now is, is there even a record in a government database of which child belongs to which parent? We don't know the answer to that question. But there are a lot of reasons, including this exchange, that would make us think that they don't. They don't know."

   "Ira Glass: OK, so that was a week ago. What's happened since?",
   "Kevin Sieff: So, Rochelle reached out to one of the legal service providers who work with children who are detained after crossing the border. And these are organizations that represent children through their deportation proceedings, through their asylum hearings. And these organizations keep track of the kids that they're working with.",
   "Kevin Sieff: They each have a list of the kids. And Rochelle kind of got lucky, and the person she reached out to did actually have a record of this girl and was able to tell Rochelle where the girl was being held.",
   "Ira Glass: She found the name of the shelter?",
   "Kevin Sieff: She found the shelter, yeah. So then the next step was for her to get to the shelter to try to set up basically an appointment. So on Thursday afternoon, she drove to the shelter. And she walked in and there the girl was. I talked to her right afterwards.",
   "Rochelle Garza: She looked like her dad, so I recognized her right away. I felt I felt really emotional about it actually, when I saw her, just because I could see her dad's face in her face. I had to obviously, any time you go and you introduce yourself to a child, like they don't know who you are. I obviously explained my relationship to her dad and to her and that I've been looking for her.",
   "Rochelle Garza: And her eyes turned really red when I mentioned her dad. And I asked her if she wanted to write him a letter and she was like, yes. And so she frantically wrote this letter, and I gave her the time to do that.",
   "Ira Glass: And so this girl, she's 12 years old. What did Rochelle say? Is she doing OK?",
   "Kevin Sieff: Yeah, the girl's doing OK. Rochelle said she looks healthy. She's wearing a uniform given to her, a sort of polo shirt given to her by the shelter. And she was wearing a bunch of friendship bracelets that I guess she's learned to make there. And then Rochelle had to do this thing, which is explain that this girl probably is not going to see her dad any time soon, and she might not even talk to him any time soon.",
   "Rochelle Garza: The way you explain it is, like, you kind of have to explain what's going on in the national realm, right? You have to say there was this executive order and there was this decision out of the courts, and put it in that kind of context so that I mean the thing is, I don't have an answer for her, Kevin. Like, I can't tell her, you're for sure going to get a phone call this day. You're for sure going to be reunited with him on this day. All I can say is, I don't know.",
   "Ira Glass: Kevin, I thought the policy had changed. Like, the president announced that we are no longer separating families from children. And in fact, the government announced that they had reunited over 500 children.",
   "Kevin Sieff: Yeah, I mean, the government has made these announcements about their plans to reunify families. But when you talk to the lawyers who are representing the parents, nothing has changed at all. And in many cases, not only are the families not reunified, but these lawyers still can't figure out where the children are being held.",
   "Ira Glass: And what do we know about the 500-plus kids who the government says they reunited?",
   "Kevin Sieff: I mean, the government has said that they've reunited these families. When I talk to lawyers who are representing hundreds of parents I mean, there's one organization that's representing 376, another that's representing I think over 400 now. I haven't heard of a single at least as of a few days ago, I haven't heard of a single reunification."

So if I don't remember specifics, like, that's not to disrespect you or anything like that, because I know this was very personal to you. It's just that I don't remember. There was so many people and I did so many bad things, so.",

Another person got 40-something months to something months. Take all them, add all of them together, and see can you face up to them? Bad mofo, ooh. Yeah, yeah, that'd be appropriate. Yeah.",

   "Aj Smith: I think people have been to church. I think people have done church. And I think people don't have great experiences with church. And because of that, I think the last thing people want to do is waste a day, in their mind, of the weekend coming to church.",

   "AJ Smith: I love what you all are doing, but you know OK, maybe I'll come by sometime. They ain't coming to church. They've been to church. Their uncle started a church 20 years ago, and they had to go sit through three hours on a Sunday morning, couldn't wait to get out of there. They couldn't wait till they were 18, and they didn't have to go to church anymore."

   "David Kestenbaum: So if you push the button, it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. And the equipment these days can be tiny, like a little box you can hold in your hand. And it does the following. It takes a single particle of light, a photon, it sends it at a kind of mirror that can make the photon either go left or right. You can think of it that way.",
   "Ira Glass: Like at random it'll go either left or right?",
   "David Kestenbaum: Well, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small things, it actually goes both. It's not that we don't know. It actually goes left and right at the same time.",
   "Ira Glass: OK.",
   "David Kestenbaum: So that's super weird, right? But that is actually true, and demonstrated, and like we've known that since the 20s.",
   "Ira Glass: OK. So then what happens in this device in Geneva?",
   "David Kestenbaum: Yeah, so the device fires a photon which can go left or right. And then the device looks to see, well, where did it go? And we know the particle's in both places, right? But when the machine looks, it only finds it in one place. It shows it went either left or right, which doesn't make sense, right? Because we know from the math that the particle did go to both places. So why did we only see it in one of those places?",
   "Ira Glass: And what's the answer?",
   "David Kestenbaum: All right, so one of the answers is that the photon is in both places, left and right, but just in different universes.",
   "Ira Glass: Wait. So you're saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror, it actually creates an entire duplicate of our universe. And in one of those universes, the photon is on the left, and the other it is on the right?",
   "David Kestenbaum: Yes. It both went left and right. Those are just in different universes. The math of it makes a lot of the math of it is very, like, streamlined and simple. I remember the day I saw it in class, and I was like, oh, my god. Maybe it's true.",
   "Ira Glass: Yeah.",
   "David Kestenbaum: So those boxes you filled out on the app",
   "Ira Glass: You mean the box where I typed in \"shave off beard tonight\", and the box where I typed in, keep beard?",
   "David Kestenbaum: Right, right. So it'll basically choose one of those boxes if the photon goes left, and the other box if the photon goes right."

   "Emily: Yeah. Going on the plane, too, for me, it was kind of thinking about the last time I took that flight was when I was a baby. And touching down, I remember thinking that the last time I was here was when I was five months old."
