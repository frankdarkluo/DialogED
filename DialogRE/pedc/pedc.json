But as soon as I saw her face, I just thought she was the most beautiful thing, and I had to have her, and I wanted to see that face every day, and I wanted to care for her. And I didn't know anything about bringing up parrots, or feeding them, or caring for them. I just wanted to take her home like a big like a treasure."

And my children are a very big threat to our relationship because we have physical contact with each other. She sees me carrying them and cooking for them and touching them and picking them up.

   "speaker 2: The shelter?",
   "speaker 1: Yeah. And I have not been contacted, and neither has my client.",
   "speaker 2: OK. What's the name of the minor?",
   "speaker 3: So she gives the name of this girl to the operator and he looks her up and finds her in the system.",
   "speaker 2: What I can do is to try to do try to send the shelter inquiry again. I mean, because they usually do contact. But right now, with the high volume of minors that are entering the United States, it's a little complicated for them.",
   "speaker 4: Hey Kevin, when he says the high volume of minors entering the United States, is that what's happening?",
   "speaker 3: No. I mean, there is no surge of minors crossing the border. In fact, there are fewer people crossing the border than almost any time in the last decade. What there's a surge of is a surge of families being separated, and that's what's changed.",
   "speaker 4: And that's why he's getting so many calls.",
   "speaker 3: Right. There are children and parents who can't find each other.",
   "speaker 1: Maybe there's a better way for us to do this. Can I send a letter to you or to the shelter somehow, saying that I'm representing her father? That way I can at least confirm, you know, where she is and so I can go ahead and start working on her case."

I mean, and this, I think, is the biggest concern that lawyers have right now is, is there even a record in a government database of which child belongs to which parent? We don't know the answer to that question. But there are a lot of reasons, including this exchange, that would make us think that they don't. They don't know."

   "speaker 1: OK, so that was a week ago. What's happened since?",
   "speaker 2: So, Rochelle reached out to one of the legal service providers who work with children who are detained after crossing the border. And these are organizations that represent children through their deportation proceedings, through their asylum hearings. And these organizations keep track of the kids that they're working with.",
   "speaker 2: They each have a list of the kids. And Rochelle kind of got lucky, and the person she reached out to did actually have a record of this girl and was able to tell Rochelle where the girl was being held.",
   "speaker 1: She found the name of the shelter?",
   "speaker 2: She found the shelter, yeah. So then the next step was for her to get to the shelter to try to set up basically an appointment. So on Thursday afternoon, she drove to the shelter. And she walked in and there the girl was. I talked to her right afterwards.",
   "speaker 3: She looked like her dad, so I recognized her right away. I felt I felt really emotional about it actually, when I saw her, just because I could see her dad's face in her face. I had to obviously, any time you go and you introduce yourself to a child, like they don't know who you are. I obviously explained my relationship to her dad and to her and that I've been looking for her.",
   "speaker 3: And her eyes turned really red when I mentioned her dad. And I asked her if she wanted to write him a letter and she was like, yes. And so she frantically wrote this letter, and I gave her the time to do that.",
   "speaker 1: And so this girl, she's 12 years old. What did Rochelle say? Is she doing OK?",
   "speaker 2: Yeah, the girl's doing OK. Rochelle said she looks healthy. She's wearing a uniform given to her, a sort of polo shirt given to her by the shelter. And she was wearing a bunch of friendship bracelets that I guess she's learned to make there. And then Rochelle had to do this thing, which is explain that this girl probably is not going to see her dad any time soon, and she might not even talk to him any time soon.",
   "speaker 3: The way you explain it is, like, you kind of have to explain what's going on in the national realm, right? You have to say there was this executive order and there was this decision out of the courts, and put it in that kind of context so that I mean the thing is, I don't have an answer for her, Kevin. Like, I can't tell her, you're for sure going to get a phone call this day. You're for sure going to be reunited with him on this day. All I can say is, I don't know.",
   "speaker 1: Kevin, I thought the policy had changed. Like, the president announced that we are no longer separating families from children. And in fact, the government announced that they had reunited over 500 children.",
   "speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, the government has made these announcements about their plans to reunify families. But when you talk to the lawyers who are representing the parents, nothing has changed at all. And in many cases, not only are the families not reunified, but these lawyers still can't figure out where the children are being held.",
   "speaker 1: And what do we know about the 500-plus kids who the government says they reunited?",
   "speaker 2: I mean, the government has said that they've reunited these families. When I talk to lawyers who are representing hundreds of parents I mean, there's one organization that's representing 376, another that's representing I think over 400 now. I have not heard of a single at least as of a few days ago, I have not heard of a single reunification."

   "speaker 1: So if you push the button, it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. And the equipment these days can be tiny, like a little box you can hold in your hand. And it does the following. It takes a single particle of light, a photon, it sends it at a kind of mirror that can make the photon either go left or right. You can think of it that way.",
   "speaker 2: Like at random it'll go either left or right?",
   "speaker 1: Well, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small things, it actually goes both. It's not that we don't know. It actually goes left and right at the same time.",
   "speaker 2: OK.",
   "speaker 1: So that's super weird, right? But that is actually true, and demonstrated, and like we've known that since the 20s.",
   "speaker 2: OK. So then what happens in this device in Geneva?",
   "speaker 1: Yeah, so the device fires a photon which can go left or right. And then the device looks to see, well, where did it go? And we know the particle's in both places, right? But when the machine looks, it only finds it in one place. It shows it went either left or right, which doesn't make sense, right? Because we know from the math that the particle did go to both places. So why did we only see it in one of those places?",
   "speaker 2: And what's the answer?",
   "speaker 1: All right, so one of the answers is that the photon is in both places, left and right, but just in different universes.",
   "speaker 2: Wait. So you're saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror, it actually creates an entire duplicate of our universe. And in one of those universes, the photon is on the left, and the other it is on the right?",
   "speaker 1: Yes. It both went left and right. Those are just in different universes. The math of it makes a lot of the math of it is very, like, streamlined and simple. I remember the day I saw it in class, and I was like, oh, my god. Maybe it's true.",
   "speaker 2: Yeah.",
   "speaker 1: So those boxes you filled out on the app",
   "speaker 2: You mean the box where I typed in \"shave off beard tonight\", and the box where I typed in, keep beard?",
   "speaker 1: Right, right. So it'll basically choose one of those boxes if the photon goes left, and the other box if the photon goes right."

For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",
