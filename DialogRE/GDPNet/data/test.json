[[["speaker 1: So if you push the button, it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. And the equipment these days can be tiny, like a little box you can hold in your hand. And it does the following. It takes a single particle of light, a photon, it sends it at a kind of mirror that can make the photon either go left or right. You can think of it that way.", "speaker 2: Like at random it'll go either left or right?", "speaker 1: Well, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small things, it actually goes both.

But that is actually true, and demonstrated, and like we've known that since the 20s.", "speaker 2: OK. So then what happens in this device in Geneva?", "speaker 1: Yeah, so the device fires a photon which can go left or right. And then the device looks to see, well, where did it go? And we know the particle's in both places, right? But when the machine looks, it only finds it in one place. It shows it went either left or right, which doesn't make sense, right? Because we know from the math that the particle did go to both places. So why did we only see it in one of those places?", "speaker 2: And what's the answer?", "speaker 1: All right, so one of the answers is that the photon is in both places, left and right, but just in different universes.", "speaker 2: Wait. So you're saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror, it actually creates an entire duplicate of our universe. And in one of those universes, the photon is on the left, and the other it is on the right?", "speaker 1: Yes. It both went left and right. Those are just in different universes.
